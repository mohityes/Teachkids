 ![real life multi](https://github.com/mohityes/Teachkids/blob/master/images/tablestables.PNG "real life multi")
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 52.) Topic: Method of Multiplication
### Soln: Different Levels for Different methods of Multiplication.Like Grid is the simplest and Long is relatively hard.
##### Level 1) Grid multiplication.Player will need to calculate choclates he can buy from the money he have.There will be tools like fork which will change the denominations of money like. `345` can be forked in `300 + 40 + 5` rupees. Then he can see how many 5 rupee choclate he can buy using exchange of money with shopkeeper.  

##### Level 2) Cumulative Multiplication: For example `10*10 = 100`. So Player will jump `10` times like Mario on the coin brick to generate `10` choclates every time. By the time he end , he will have generated `100` Choclates.

##### Level 3) Egyptian Method: First things first. What the heck is Egyptian method of Multiplication. For example if you want to do `31*42` , you can do it as follows:-
Step1) First of all, we need to place `1` and `31`, and start doubling the two quantities. Like this:
![alt text](https://github.com/mohityes/Teachkids/blob/master/images/egyptianmulti.PNG "egyptianmulti")
You’ll get different multiplications of `31` by powers of `2`, like this:
![alt text](https://github.com/mohityes/Teachkids/blob/master/images/egyptianmulti1.PNG "egyptianmulti1")
Now you need to look for the numbers that help you solve the multiplication `31 x 42`. To do this, you just need to find the powers of `2` that add up to `42`:
`32 + 8 + 2 = 42`
![alt text](https://github.com/mohityes/Teachkids/blob/master/images/egyptianmulti2.PNG "egyptianmulti2")
At this point, you will have managed to break down 31 x 42 into sums that you can calculate easily:
`31 x 42 = 31 x (2 + 8 +32)`
`= 31 x 2 + 31 x 8 + 31 x 32`
`= 62 + 248 + 992`
`= 310 + 992 = 1,302`
And as you can see, the result we get once again is `31 x 42 = 1,302`

#### So, now you know what's what.We can make a tapping and drag and drop game in which they will tap to double the amount and drag and drop in a addition box to add them together.

##### Level 4) Chinese Method: So here's a short intro to chinese method.
####### Let's multiply `31` and `42`.
First, place:
*   3 horizontal lines separated by the same distance, and 1 more horizontal line a bit further apart.
 *   4 vertical lines separated by the same distance, and 2 more vertical lines further apart.

![alt text](https://github.com/mohityes/Teachkids/blob/master/images/methodofmulti0.PNG "chinese method 1")
Next, count the number of times each pair of lines cross. Make sure you keep track of which ones correspond to the tens and which represent units:

  *  Where the unit lines cross, we get the units of the result (since the product of units gives units).
  *  Where the unit lines and tens lines cross, we get the tens of the result (since the product of units and tens gives tens).
  *  Where the tens lines cross, we get the hundreds of the result (since the product of tens gives hundreds).

![alt text](https://github.com/mohityes/Teachkids/blob/master/images/methodofmulti.PNG "chinese multi 2")

Now you can arrange all the information you’ve obtained into the result of 31 x 42:

 *   2 units.
 *   10 tens, which is the same as 1 hundred.
 *   12 hundreds, which when added to the hundred given by the 10 tens makes 13 hundred. These 13 hundreds can be written as 1 thousand and 3 hundreds.

So, we’ve got:

1 thousand, 3 hundreds, and 2 units: `1,302`

#####  So we can provide horizontal and vertical sticks which can be drag and drop to do the multiplication in chinese.

## 53.) Topic: Multiplication and division in real life
### Soln:There will be multiple cartoon characters like Bheem,Motu,Patlu,Ben10, etc which will distribute various things among them like:
##### 1)Fruits distribution(Division):For example if there are 6 fruits and 3 friends, they will have to drag and drop 2 fruits to baskets of each player. The number of Player and Fruits will change.
##### 2) Barter System(Multiplication): For example if bheem have 10 apples and 1 apple can be exchanged with monkey for 2 bananas then how many bananas can he get. Again a drag and drop game can be made showcasing barter system.
